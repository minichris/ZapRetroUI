# Zap's Retro UI (ZapRetroUI)
When I logged in today, I was annoyed to find Blizz had messed up the UI again. So I made this addon to fix it back to how it was, more or less. It is still a little buggy and sloppy in places, but I hope you like it regardless. It is based on an addon by Floraline, but theirs doesn't to as good a job of replicating the original UI as this one, IMO.

Please report any issues.
